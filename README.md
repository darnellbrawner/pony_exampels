# Pony Problem / Solutions

I just started learning Pony and am NEW to anything other than higher level languages such as ruby, python, sql.
I figured a good way to learn and would be to start small and since there aren't many pony code examples.
I creating this repository to start the process.

Pony Playground if you don't want to setup env locally.
